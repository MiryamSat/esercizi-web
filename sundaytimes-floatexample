    <p><strong>live: British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari set for release</strong> </p>
    <p><i>The ceasefire was delayed by nearly three hours, 
        as the list of Israeli hostages to be released had not
         been shared and the IDF continued strikes on Gaza</i></p>
    <div class="articolo">
             <p>Ninety Palestinians held in Israeli prisons are due to be freed 
                after the release of three Israeli captives 
                held in Gaza under a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.
                The ceasefire began at 09:15 GMT after a nearly three-hour delay 
                during which Israeli attacks killed at least 19 Palestinians.

                Israel says 3 captives to be freed at 14:00 GMT; 4 more in a week
                PM Netanyahu’s office says the release of three captives held in Gaza will take place 
                after 14:00 GMT.
                In a statement, it also said four other female captives would be freed in seven days.
                The six-week, phase one ceasefire includes the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from 
                central Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza.
                The deal requires 600 truckloads of humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza every day
                 of the ceasefire, 50 carrying fuel, with 300 of the trucks allocated to the north, where
                  conditions for civilians are particularly harsh.
